# StudyBuddy

This is a lightweight static website for your Personalized Educational Content Platform.

## Files
- `index.html` — Landing page with hero, problem, solution, features, plans, and a form section.
- `privacy.html`, `terms.html` — Starter legal pages.
- `styles.css`, `script.js` — Styling and behavior.
- `assets/logo.svg`, `assets/favicon.svg` — Simple gradient logo and favicon.

## Customize
1. **Branding**: Replace `assets/logo.svg` and update colors in `styles.css` (`--primary`, `--accent`).
2. **Form**: In `index.html`, replace `GOOGLE_FORM_URL` with your Google Form link (or embed the form directly if using Google Sites).
3. **Copy**: Edit any section text to match your tone and offering.

## Deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo, push these files, and enable Pages.
- **Netlify**: Drag‑and‑drop the folder into app.netlify.com.
- **Vercel**: Import the repo; no build step needed.

## Google Sites
Google Sites doesn't import HTML files directly. Use this site as a reference or host it separately (Pages/Netlify). You can also embed parts of it inside Google Sites with the "Embed" URL option after you deploy.
